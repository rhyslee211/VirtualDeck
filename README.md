# VirtualDeck

## What is Virtual Deck

Virtual Deck is a stream deck built into your computer. Instead of buying an entire new device, users can assign keybindings to macros that perform tasks:

* Muting mic in OBS
* Switching OBS Scenes
* Run python and other applications at the click of a button

## To run clone the repository and run the following commands.

```powershell
npm install
npm start
```

## Ideas and Plans

Window allows configuration and button activation.

Small pop up window that allows button activation, and can be hidden with macro.

Phone as controller option.
